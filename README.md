# Charcoal Events

The Charcoal Events base library offers an innovative solution to a longstanding limitation of PHP: its inherently
synchronous execution model. This library simulates event-driven architectures by leveraging callbacks, allowing PHP
developers to experience a semblance of asynchronous programming, even if it's not native to the language.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
documentation website:
